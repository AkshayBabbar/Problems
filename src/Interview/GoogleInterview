Wordle is a game where there's a secret 5-letter word. The player has to identify the word in 6 tries. Every time they try a word, they get clues on how close the word is to the secret word.

For example:
Secret word:  CHALK
Player input: BLAST


Output: RYGRR
Explanation for output: B, S, T in red color (R), L in yellow color (Y), A in green color (G).

-Red color means the letter doesn't occur at all.
-Yellow color means the letter exists in secret word but is not at the right position.
-Green color means the letter exists in the secret word and is at the right position.

Qn: Given a secret word and player's input, return how correct the input was as a string consists of R, Y, and G.


public static String retryOutput(String input, String skey){
  StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();
  HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
  //BLOOT - INPUT
  //RRYGR
  //COKOK - Secret

  for(int i =0; i<input.length();i++)
  {
    if(input.charAt(i) == skey.charAt(i)){
      out.append("G");
    }
    else{
      for(int j =0; j<skey.length();j++){
      if(input.charAt(i) == skey.charAt(j)){
        out.append("Y");
      }
      }
     output.append("R");
  }
}
  // Input length<5.
  // DUPLICATE AAAAA
  // DUPLICATE SSSSS
